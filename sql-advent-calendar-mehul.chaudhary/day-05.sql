-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

/* 
GOAL:
List ALL elves + unka return_date.
Agar return_date NULL ho → 'Still resting' dikhana hai.

TABLES:
elves(elf_id, elf_name)
vacations(elf_id, start_date, return_date)
*/

SELECT
    e.elf_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN v.return_date IS NULL THEN 'Still resting'
        ELSE v.return_date
    END AS return_date      -- column name exactly 'return_date'
FROM elves e
LEFT JOIN vacations v
    ON e.elf_id = v.elf_id;
