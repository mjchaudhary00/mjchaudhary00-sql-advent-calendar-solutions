-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT
    subject,
    FIRST_VALUE(score) OVER w AS first_score,
    LAST_VALUE(score) OVER w AS last_score
FROM daily_quiz_scores
WINDOW w AS (
    PARTITION BY subject
    ORDER BY quiz_date
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
);
