-- Difficulty: hard
--

-- The North Pole Network wants to see who's the most active in the holiday chat each day. Write a query to count how many messages each user sent, then find the most active user(s) each day. If multiple users tie for first place, return all of them.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: npn_users
--   user_id: INT
--   user_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: npn_messages
--   message_id: INT
--   sender_id: INT
--   sent_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH daily_message_counts AS (
    SELECT
        DATE(sent_at) AS message_date,
        sender_id,
        COUNT(*) AS message_count
    FROM npn_messages
    GROUP BY DATE(sent_at), sender_id
),
ranked_users AS (
    SELECT
        message_date,
        sender_id,
        message_count,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY message_date
            ORDER BY message_count DESC
        ) AS activity_rank
    FROM daily_message_counts
)
SELECT
    r.message_date,
    u.user_id,
    u.user_name,
    r.message_count
FROM ranked_users r
JOIN npn_users u
    ON r.sender_id = u.user_id
WHERE r.activity_rank = 1
ORDER BY r.message_date, u.user_name;
