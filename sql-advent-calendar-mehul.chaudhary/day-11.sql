-- Title: Winter Market Sweater Search
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- At the winter market, Cindy Lou is browsing the clothing inventory and wants to find all items with "sweater" in their name. But the challenge is the color and item columns have inconsistent capitalization. Can you write a query to return only the sweater names and their cleaned-up colors.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: winter_clothing
--   item_id: INT
--   item_name: VARCHAR
--   color: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
    item_name,
    color,
    -- cleaned fields
    UPPER(SUBSTR(item_name, 1, 1)) || LOWER(SUBSTR(item_name, 2)) AS clean_item_name,
    UPPER(SUBSTR(color, 1, 1)) || LOWER(SUBSTR(color, 2)) AS clean_color
FROM winter_clothing
WHERE LOWER(item_name) LIKE '%sweater%';
